ProjectFile.txt is the file I fed to the Google Gemini CLI to create the project.
Errors.txt file was the file I kept feeding it with errors as it didn't do it all in one shot.

Run the project with py main.py 
Enter the stock you want to check, example:  TSLA
and all done, you get the JSON back with the values you need.

Please note that you need an account with Interactive Brokers and you need to have IBKR running on the machine you are running the code on.
